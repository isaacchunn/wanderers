# Lab 3
- The task allocations are in `Post_Lab_Meeting_Minutes.pdf`
- The same is input in table form in the `Team Backlog (Lab3)` file
- The Risk Contingency Plan included is not included in the Lab, it is just an initiative for us to document down what the team would do in the event a risk materialises.
